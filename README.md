# AccelerateExample

Sample usage of the Accelerate framework

## Usage

Uncomment the various method calls to compare CPU time necessary to compute matrix multiplication in a naive implementation vs an accelerated implementation.

## Results

### Naive

Note the spike.

### Accelerated

Note the downward trend once we reach a larger dataset. Total size of matrices is approximately 105,000,000 in last data point.

## Notes

Results for matrix multiplication obtained from running on a Late 2011 MacBook Pro 13‚Äù i7 with 16GB memory
